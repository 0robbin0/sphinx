# .git-blame-ignore-revs
# Commits listed in this file are ignored by default in GitHub's interactive
# 'blame' view (e.g. https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blame/master/README.rst).
# Lines beginning with a '#' character are ignored, and may be used as comments.

# Commits should be listed as one unabbreviated SHA-1 per line, with an
# explanatory comment above the entry. Maintain graph ordering, with later
# commits listed after earlier commits in this file.

# For more details, see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame
# git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
