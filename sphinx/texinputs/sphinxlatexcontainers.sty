% The purpose of this file is to provide a dummy environment sphinxcontainer
% which will be inserted for every container directive the container class
% name will be passed as the argument to the environment. User-defined
% formatting of directives can be achieved by renewing the definition of 
% this environment, and branching on the value of the argument.
