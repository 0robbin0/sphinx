Core developers
===============

The core developers of Sphinx have write access to the main repository.  They
can commit changes, accept/reject pull requests, and manage items on the issue
tracker.

You do not need to be a core developer or have write access to be involved in
the development of Sphinx.  You can submit patches or create pull requests
from forked repositories and have a core developer add the changes for you.

The following are some general guidelines for core developers:

* Questionable or extensive changes should be submitted as a pull request
  instead of being committed directly to the main repository.  The pull
  request should be reviewed by another core developer before it is merged.

* Trivial changes can be committed directly but be sure to keep the repository
  in a good working state and that all tests pass before pushing your changes.

* When committing code written by someone else, please attribute the original
  author in the commit message and any relevant :file:`CHANGES` entry.
