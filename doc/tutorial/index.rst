Sphinx tutorial
===============

In this tutorial you will build a simple documentation project using Sphinx,
and view it in your web browser as HTML.
We will include narrative, handwritten documentation,
as well as autogenerated API documentation.

The tutorial is aimed towards people willing to learn
the fundamentals of Sphinx,
how projects are created and structured,
and how to contribute to an existing project.
To showcase Sphinx automatic documentation generation capabilities
we will use Python, which is the default :term:`domain`:
even though several other languages are supported,
they all work in a similar way.

To follow the tutorial you will need a working Python installation for development.
We will use *Python virtual environments* to create our project,
you can read more about them in the `Python Packaging User Guide`_.
